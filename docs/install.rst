Installation
============

We do not provide anything fancy in terms of installation, at this time, but the
only thing that you have to do to start using the stuff, once you have checked
out the repository from github, is to include the path to the top level folder
where the package lives into the ``$PYTHOPATH`` environmental variable.

Note we provide setup scripts to automate that, although we need to work on supporting
some platform---see `this issue <https://github.com/AstroPix/astropix-analysis/issues/2>`_.
