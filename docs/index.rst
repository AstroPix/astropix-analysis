   contain the root `toctree` directive.

astropix-analysis documentation
===============================

This repository contains a number of facilities relevant for the aquisition,
decoding, manipulation and analysis of astropix data, including

* :ref:`fmt`
* :ref:`fileio`
* :ref:`legacy`
* :ref:`reference`

(Admittedly, the scope of the repo is not well defined, yet, and you should not
expect things around here to be stable. You will also notice that the documentation
is fairly sparse.)

If you are not sure where to go from here, you should probably peek at the
:ref:`api` page.
