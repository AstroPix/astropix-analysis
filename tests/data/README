This folder contains small chunks of data for testing purposes.


20250722_094253
---------------
Small run from a charge-injection threshold scan, with the .log file being written
by the DAQ and the corresponding .apx file created by processing the former.


20250723_092534
---------------
Similar run from a threshold scan, but this time using the new DAQ facilities to
write the .apx file directly. (Ironically, the .log file here is a real log file.)
All the other files contain decoded hits in various formats using the new processing
facilities.


decode
------
Contains a small .log file assembled by hand (by Grant and Andrea while in Pisa
on July 23, 2025) to illustrate all the different ways  in which decoding can be
difficult. The corresponding .csv file was created by Grant's decoder. A verbatim
copy of the various problematic readout is includes in the ``test_decode.py``
unit test.


scan
----
These are some files taken from a threshold scan performed in Pisa while Grant
was visiting, in July 2025. The original scan was named v4, and the settings were

VPDAC 10 -> TuneDAC 0--7 -> Col 9

TuneDAC 0 is a nice s0-curve, with a 50% point more or less in the middle of the
range, while TuneDAC 5 never makes it to 100%.
