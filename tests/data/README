This folder contains small chunks of data for testing purposes.


20250722_094253
---------------
Small run from a charge-injection threshold scan with v4, with the .log file being written
by the DAQ and the corresponding .apx file created by processing the former.


20250723_092534
---------------
Similar run from a threshold scan with v4, but this time using the new DAQ facilities to
write the .apx file directly. (Ironically, the .log file here is a real log file.)
All the other files contain decoded hits in various formats using the new processing
facilities.


decode
------
Contains a small .log file assembled by hand (by Grant and Andrea while in Pisa
on July 23, 2025) to illustrate all the different ways  in which v4 decoding can be
difficult. The corresponding .csv file was created by Grant's decoder. A verbatim
copy of the various problematic readout is includes in the ``test_decode.py``
unit test.


20250729_18524
--------------
Sample data run with v3 from a threshold scan at Desy (from Lisa on August 14, 2025).


quad_chip
---------
Small binary sample file with a quad-chip setup (from Adrian on August 20, 2025).
These are just hits, back to back, framed by the FPGA and written straight from the board.

Original message from Adrian. For clarification: The bin file contains the first ~1001 astropix hits (the first 22000 bytes of data, rounded up to the end of the frame). I decoded by hand the last few binary frames to make sure that the content of the two files end at the same point.
